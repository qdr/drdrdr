### ABSTRACT

The job guarantee (JG) is a public option for jobs. It is a permanent, federally funded, and locally administered program that supplies voluntary employment opportunities on demand for all who are ready and willing to work at a living wage. 

While it is first and foremost a jobs program, it has the potential to be transformative by advancing the public purpose and improving working conditions, people’s everyday lives, and the economy as a whole.

This working paper provides a blueprint for operationalizing the proposal. It addresses frequently asked questions and common concerns. It begins by outlining some of the core propositions in the existing literature that have motivated the JG proposal. These propositions suggest specific design and implementation features. (Some questions are answered in greater detail in appendix III). The paper presents the core objectives and expected benefits of the program, and suggests an institutional structure, funding mechanism, and project design and administration.

**KEYWORDS**: Job Guarantee; Unemployment; Full Employment; Living Wage; Policy Design


## I. CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT
	
For the purposes of this paper full employment is defined as a situation where any person of legal working age who wants to work is able to obtain employment at a living wage and decent working conditions. This includes but is not limited to new entrants in the labor market, people in “hidden unemployment” who are not normally counted in the official statistics, and individuals who are employed involuntarily in part-time working arrangements or other forms of precarious work.


At the macroeconomic level, unemployment is understood as:

* **A monetary problem**: It is a consequence of business cycles dynamics and profit-seeking firms behavior, as well as the State’s inadequate management of the currency and the monetary system.

* **A situation that cannot be remedied by private firms**: The private sector is unable to produce and maintain tight full employment over the long run.

* **A problem that is best understood as a silent epidemic**: There is a distinct and discernable geographical pattern and propagation mechanism of unemployment, which mimics the behavior of a virus or mass contagion (Tcherneva 2017). Joblessness behaves like a disease and generates large social, health, and economic costs.

* **A problem that is already “paid for”**: The costs of these social and economic ills—both in real and financial terms—are already “paid for” by the economy and society at large.

* **A problem by design and a public sector failure**: Unemployment is a problem created by concrete policy measures (targeting a non-accelerating rate of unemployment [NAIRU], austerity policies). The government has chosen an explicit policy of keeping a percentage of the population in involuntary unemployment (the NAIRU is a policy benchmark). The government is also responsible for supporting the unemployed, i.e., the unemployed are already in the public sector. Government, public institutions, and civil society are not only paying the direct cost of unemployment, but more importantly are already bearing the large associated real costs of unemployment.

* **A moral failure**: Unemployment has been used as the main bulwark against inflationand economic instability and is considered a “necessary evil.” The idea that some people will necessarily lose their jobs and livelihoods in the fight against other economic ills is a profound moral failure of the economics profession. 

Unemployment is the failure and responsibility of the public sector and it is already “paid for.” By contrast, the JG offers a superior policy option to the current approach, and one that is macroeconomically sound and humane. It pays to employ the unemployed, preventing and reducing the outsized costs of unemployment, supporting the production of valuable public goods, and investing in and empowering people, planet, and community.




## II. OBJECTIVES OF THE JOB GUARANTEE
### Core Policy Objective of the Job Guarantee
* To provide decent jobs at decent pay on demand to all individuals of legal working age who want to work, irrespective of labor market status, race, sex, color, or creed.

### AdditionalObjectives
* To guarantee a basic human right, as outlined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s call for an Economic Bill of Rights.
* To institute a public option for work, i.e., an employment safety net.
* To create job opportunities in close proximity to the unemployed.
* To create suitable work opportunities for people of varied skill levels.
* To serve the public purpose.
* To establish an effective minimum wage for the economy as a whole.
* To operate as an “employment buffer stock” in stabilizing the business cycle.
* To enhance price stability by using the JG’s buffer stock mechanism and minimum wage feature.
* To serve as a preventative policy that inoculates against the vast economic, social and political costs of unemployment.
* To be used as an institution vehicle for addressing other social ills—e.g., environmental concerns, care needs, urban blight, etc.
* To put people and their needs at the forefront of public policy, in order to empower and support them.


## III. KEY PROGRAM FEATURES

* **Permanent but voluntary**: The program is permanent. It offers employment
opportunities in the community to perform socially useful work.

* **A living wage**: It offers a wage-benefit package, establishing a floor to living incomes. The wage in this proposal is $15 per hour plus benefits.

* **Local**: The program takes the contract to the worker, creating jobs where the
unemployed live.

* **Targeted**: By design, the program creates the greatest number of jobs in communities with the greatest number of unemployed people, who are facing multiple other social deprivations.

*** Federally funded, locally administered**: Since it is an employment safety net, and for financial sustainability reasons, the program is funded by the federal government, but primarily administered by local and municipal governments, nonprofits and/or social enterprises, and cooperatives.

* **An “add on” program**: This is a new program that serves as an option to (but does not displace) existing programs. For example, people would have a choice between continuing to receive unemployment insurance (UI) or enrolling in the program. If they choose the former but still have trouble finding conventional private or public sector work once UI benefits have been exhausted, they will still have the option of enrolling in the JG program.

* **Not a workfare program**: The program does not require people to work for their
existing benefits (e.g., Medicare, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
[SNAP], Head Start, etc.).

* **Community Jobs Banks**: The program serves as a repository of various employment
opportunities. It does not displace existing public sector work. It is authorized as a separate program under the Department of Labor (DOL) and provides employment opportunities on standby.

* **A safety net and a transitional jobs program**: As a safety net, it gives opportunities to anyone who wishes to work at the base wage-benefit package,irrespective of their labor market status or situation. As a transitional program, it serves as a stepping stone to paid work—from unemployment to employment or from JG employment to other forms of private, public, and nonprofit employment.

* **Fits JG jobs to people**: It meets people where they are in terms of ability. It provides suitable, useful work opportunities, designed to be appropriate for the education or skill level of the applicant.

* **Provides working day options**: The JG offers part-time and flexible work
arrangements, as needed, for caregivers, students, etc.

* **Jobs for all**: The program does not exclude any individual or group of people who want to work. The design must be sensitive to the needs of special groups such as veterans, at-risk youth, ex-convicts, or people with disabilities.

* **Invests in people**: It offers training, education, and apprenticeship opportunities.

* **Invests in communities**: The JG aims to match unfilled community needs with
unemployed or underemployed people who could work to meet them.

* **Invests in the public good**: It separates the offer of employment from the profitability of employment. Projects are created to serve community needs, rather than prioritizing whether the projects are deemed “profitable” in the narrow sense.

* **Invests in the environment**: The program focuses on addressing environmental
concerns.


## IV. EXPECTED BENEFITS

* **Full employment**: The program eliminates involuntary unemployment (as defined) and drastically reduces the associated human hardships and social afflictions.

* **Living income**: The program raises the income floor. It stabilizes incomes at the bottom of the distribution both for workers within and outside the program by establishing a genuine living wage of $15 per hour.

* **Alternative to bad jobs**: It displaces “bad” labor practices and helps to eliminate “bad” jobs. If the public employment option offers a decent job at decent pay, employers who pay poverty wages with difficult working conditions would have to match the JG pay and conditions to retain workers.

* **Establishes a “labor standard” for the economy as a whole**: Because it guarantees that every person who wishes to work can find a public-option job with a living wage-benefit package, the JG establishes the labor standard that must be met by all employers in the private, public, or nonprofit sectors. Currently 18 percent of people who live in poverty work and 44 percent of homeless people work. The labor standard of the JG ensures that no working person would live in poverty.

* **Inflation stabilization**: The program serves as a superior inflation control and macroeconomic stabilization tool. Currently the pool of the unemployed fluctuates countercyclically. In the US the amplitudes of those fluctuations are especially large and,for a half century now, growth has delivered “jobless recoveries”. Many of those who are left behind either slip into long-term unemployment, involuntary part-time employment, or drop out of the labor force altogether. Since the JG’s primary objective is to provide jobs to those who want them at all stages of the business cycle, it has an inherent countercyclical mechanism that is superior to current inflation and macroeconomic stabilization methods. The JG expands and contracts with recessions and expansions, never allowing individuals and the economy to suffer the consequences of unemployment. As such it continues to stabilize economic growth and prices, using a pool of employed individuals for the purpose rather than a reserve army of the unemployed. It stabilizes the economy by supporting people, communities, and families, and not by rending them “disposable” as in the current paradigm. 

* **Improves income distribution**: This is achieved in three ways: 1) the JG raises incomes at the bottom faster than incomes at the top; 2) the JG supports labor income, thus improving the distribution between labor and capital; 3) the JG improves the within-labor income distribution, by supporting the income and employment opportunities of the lower-skill, less-educated worker and those who currently experience shorter job tenures, longer and deeper spells of unemployment, and poorer prospects of re-employment.

* **Disrupts vicious labor market cycles**: It breaks the above-mentioned vicious unemployment and income cycles experienced by those at the bottom of the income distribution. Cure: The JG improves the physical and mental health of the previously unemployed, as well as that of their spouses and children, and improves children’s educational performance and labor market prospects.

* **Prevention**: The program reduces suicides and mortality of JG workers, as well as the so-called “deaths of despair,” due to an overall improvement in labor market conditions.


* **Economic, social, and environmental benefits**: It reduces homelessness, recidivism, and economic crimes; increases the availability of public goods and services, which are provided through the JG program; and invests in the environment, people, and community.


## V.SITUATING THE JG WITHIN A BROADER POLICY AGENDA
The JG is first and foremost a program that provides decent jobs at decent pay, but it resides within a broader policy agenda. A comprehensive policy reform that aims to address income insecurity must incorporate other forms of nonwage income support. These would include expanding Social Security and Disability benefits, reducing the retirement age and working week, and instituting a federal-level paid family leave. Furthermore, while the JG will go a long way to reducing individual and household poverty, an anti-poverty agenda ought to also include a universal child allowance policy, universal childcare, free school lunches, and a public healthcare option, to name a few.



## VI.PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
The above features and aims represent the core of the JG proposal. Program objectives and specific design features would be reevaluated and adapted to observed structural and institutional changes in labor market and other economic conditions. Indeed this blueprint does not and cannot provide a one-glove-fits-all proposal. Any JG program must be suited to the cultural, developmental, institutional, and macroeconomic context for the country that contemplates adopting it.

### 1. Short- vs. Long-Run Design and Operation
A JG implemented today will be different from a JG that operates over the long run.

If a JG program were launched today, in conditions of mass hidden unemployment and strong pent-up demand for decent well-paying jobs, the program might grow to 16 million workers (see FAQ in appendix III). Once the program is up and running, it will improve private sector employment conditions and the overall health of the economy; at that point the program will settle to a smaller size (likely, anywhere between 2 percent and 10 percent of the labor force). Indeed the size of the program will largely depend on private sector employment dynamics.

Employing everyone who is ready, willing, and able to work today is a more challenging task than making employment offers to newly unemployed people once the program has been running for a while.

Given the existing long-run labor market problems, collapse in the labor force participation rate, large pent-up demand for stable and well-paying full-time jobs, a JG could swell to 11 to 16 million people (Dantas and Wray forthcoming), which would be approximately 7–10 percent of the labor force. Experience with large-scale jobs programs of this sort (e.g., Argentina’s Plan Jefes, which employed 13 percent of the labor force) indicates that they can be up and running in a relatively short period of time. It also suggests that the program would provide a large boost to private sector activity, generating strong GDP growth and private sector employment. Fullwiler’s (forthcoming) simulations corroborate this expectation. He finds that the JG raises real GDP by $313–560 billion per year and permanently adds up to four million net new private sector jobs. These simulations do not account for the cyclical effects. In Argentina, for example,
the JG pool began shrinking steadily as the economy expanded (Tcherneva 2013).


### 2. The Superior Policy Option: Hiring the Unemployed

The policy choice before us is the following—we either have a buffer stock of unemployed people or a buffer stock of employed people. That is, either we continue under the status quo, where the pool of unemployed people expands and shrinks with recessions and expansions, or we allow the JG’s pool of employed people to shrink and expand countercyclically. Since unemployment is already “paid for” in real and financial terms, diverting these financial and real resources to running the JG program is a far superior option to the status quo. Furthermore, with the JG in place, which is inherently a countercyclical employment policy, the economy can operate at a higher level of non-inflationary output than with mass unemployment (i.e., than with an unemployed buffer stock).

The size of the program will depend on private sector employment dynamics, as well as on its popularity. If society prefers larger private sector employment and a smaller JG labor force, other macroeconomic measures can be employed (e.g., investment subsidies, tax cuts, mission- oriented finance) to shrink the pool of JG workers further. But if the program proves to be a much more desirable policy option than many poorly paid private sector jobs, it may initially be quite large, until those private sector firms meet and exceed the pay and employment conditions of the JG.

Because the program operates countercyclically by creating full employment at all stages of the business cycle (recession or expansions), it stabilizes total employment, meaning that private sector employment will not fluctuate as violently as it does today. In sum, once the program is in place, economic fluctuations will be reduced—meaning that employment in the JG will also be more stable.


### 3. Preparedness Response: Community Jobs Banks
The proposal here is to design the program as a comprehensive preparedness response. A period of planning will be required to design community job banks—these will warehouse the “on-the-shelf” jobs that can be supplied to the jobless on short notice. For this purpose, the planning period will include soliciting and identifying project-executing organizations that would serve as providers for those job opportunities. 

Designing the JG as a preparedness response can be modeled after the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Strategic National Stockpile (SNS)—the nation’s largest stockpile of essential pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in case of emergencies. The SNS is designed as a supplement to local preparedness efforts. As the CDC website explains: “When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that medicine and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, the repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies, simultaneously.”

To be able to respond adequately to public health threats, the government maintains warehouses throughout the United States that can distribute vaccines, medication, and other supplies to the local areas in the event of emergencies.

Similarly the JG can be designed as a detailed local preparedness response to joblessness, using some of the existing institutional infrastructure (more below).

The job guarantee will maintain a repository of jobs and places of work—via the Community Jobs Banks—that can quickly accommodate new entrants into the program and let them go without disruption should they find alternative employment. The ability to absorb or shed employees is not a unique challenge for the JG. Indeed every labor market segment within the private, nonprofit, or public sectors deals with new entrants and job leavers on an ongoing basis.

Furthermore, the creation of jobs relatively quickly need not be a tall task either. Experience has shown that large-scale employment programs can be up and running in a matter of a few months (e.g., the New Deal programs in the United States and Argentina’s Plan Jefes). Such programs, however, have often been implemented as emergency measures. If the JG is designed as a preparedness response, a lengthier period of assessment, design, and planning is needed for its long-run success. Once such a program is in place, finding work for any additional entrants is a much easier task by comparison. A fair amount of experimentation may be needed initially, as well as continual evaluation to improve program performance over the long run.


### 4. Preventative Features
Because part of the JG program will fluctuate countercyclically, expanding when private employment shrinks and shrinking when private employment expands, it will ensure by design that mass unemployment does not develop and accelerate as rapidly as it does under the status quo. It thereby restrains the contagion effect from an initial onset of private sector mass layoffs and serves as a preventative tool. While it will not eliminate business cycle swings, it will attenuate them. Furthermore, by securing tight full employment it will help prevent many of the existing social costs of unemployment (for more, see Tcherneva 2017).


### 5. Program Budget and Funding Mechanism
The primary challenge is to design a budget that not only ensures the program’s long-run sustainability, but also one that accommodates normal countercyclical fluctuations and large swings in enrollment, should those unexpectedly arise.

Unemployment behaves like an epidemic, developing rapidly and unexpectedly and spreading with the distinct pattern of a contagion effect. Simultaneously, it inflicts large social and human costs (Tcherneva 2017). Therefore, the proposed funding mechanism here is, in part, modeled after disaster and emergency relief in the United States.

For example, each year Congress would pass base appropriations for the management of the JG program. Because the actual level of joblessness over a given year is unknown—much as it is with large-scale disasters or smaller, localized events—the funding would have to fluctuate with need. This can be accomplished in two ways: 1) the base appropriations can be adjusted as needed using the Budget Control Act, which permits some increases in discretionary spending; and 2) unexpected annual increases in JG funding can be provided through supplementalappropriations bills that offer funding not subject to spending caps or budgetary controls.

This is the model currently used for disaster and emergency relief. Since natural disasters have intensified, the base budget has proven inadequate, necessitating very large supplemental appropriations that can be vulnerable to abuse. By contrast, the JG tames unemployment fluctuations and stabilizes employment patterns, which suggests that it will not be as reliant on supplemental appropriations as disaster and emergency relief.

The base appropriation budget will initially be estimated to fund a sizable program. To employ 11–16 million people at $15 per hour plus benefits equal to 20 percent of wages (allowing for material costs set at 25 percent of labor costs), the direct program expenditures would be about 1.3 percent to 2.4 percent of GDP (and the net cost of the JG program would vary from 0.8 percent to 2 percent of GPD, see Fullwiler [forthcoming]). This is less than what the US government spends annually on elementary and secondary education. In subsequent years, the budget will be calculated as a rolling average of actual funding from previous years. If the JG induces higher level of private sector employment and settles down to a smaller size over the course of several years, then the budget would reflect those changes and the reduced need to fund such a large program.

Adjustment in the base appropriations and supplemental appropriations are nevertheless necessary because mass layoffs can occur for any number of reasons. The main reason is that private sector profits as a share of GDP fluctuate over the business cycle, which in turn produce fluctuations in private sector employment rates. To serve as a genuine buffer stock, the budget for the JG must fluctuate in a similar fashion.

Adjustments in base and supplemental appropriations are also needed for extreme
circumstances. For example, the global financial crisis—to the dismay of many economists— resulted in almost a million unemployed individuals per month in early 2009. A standby jobs program would have provided alternative employment opportunities to the unemployed, thus remedying labor market condition much faster than what we experienced. One estimate suggest that if the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act budget funded a JG program instead, it could have created 20 million living-wage jobs, wiping out unemployment altogether and launching a strong jobs-led recovery (Tcherneva 2009). Since financial crises, geopoliticalshocks, and other events may unexpectedly generate sudden mass layoffs, the JG budget would need to increase accordingly to provide needed funding quickly.

Furthermore, disaster events such as hurricanes Harvey and Irma significantly impact local employment rates and demand a discretionary increase in jobs assistance,  similar to other discretionary increases in disaster relief funding.

Indeed, current law already provides funding for those who have lost their jobs due to natural disasters. However, it does not provide the employment opportunities, which the JG will supply. 

Congress can appropriate an employment relief fund (ERF) as a supplement to the DOL’s budget. The US DOL works with state labor department agencies and their local offices to disburse the payments for wages and materials associated with program management, similar to the way it currently disburses UI payments.

Just as it is with disaster relief, DOL offices, as well as the Presidency, can issue disaster unemployment declarations that would make additional funds available if there are sudden and acute mass layoffs in a particular area. As discussed above, such a program already exists on the books and can be incorporated into the JG budget. This is the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program, which provides unemployment benefits to those who have become unemployed as a direct result of a presidentially declared major disaster.

If funding for the entire JG program cannot be provided through the Stafford Act of 1988 (Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act), a modern unemployment emergency relief act can be passed for the purpose.


### 6. Administrative Agencies and Project-Executing Organizations
#### Department of Labor
It is proposed that the JG be under the jurisdiction of the DOL, as it is with UI. Similar to UI, states would participate in the program’s administration.

Congress appropriates funding for the DOL’s ERF. As explained above, the specific method of funding allows the DOL budget to fluctuate countercyclically in a manner consistent with hiring everyone who needs work throughout the business cycle. 

The DOL supplies the general guidelines for the kinds of projects it will authorize under the JG program. Municipalities, in cooperation with community groups, conduct assessment surveys, cataloging community needs and available resources. In consultation with the DOL, municipalities and One-Stop Job Centers create Community Jobs Banks—repositories of types of work and places that can offer employment opportunities to the unemployed on demand (more below).

In addition to providing funding to specific agencies, the DOL makes “requests for proposals,” indicating that it will fund employment initiatives by community groups, nonprofits, social entrepreneurial ventures, and the unemployed themselves for projects that serve the public purpose. Grants are approved contingent on: 1) the usefulness of activities performed, as measured by their social impact, 2) creation of employment opportunities for the unemployed, and 3) no displacement effect of existing workers. 

#### States, Municipalities, and Community Groups 
States and municipalities assist in the administration of the program. They help in the disbursement of funds and are responsible for the design and implementation at the local level. As discussed above, they conduct community assessment surveys and design the Community Jobs Bank. The involvement of citizens, local community groups, and other stakeholders that
represent public interests can ensure that the program enhances participatory democracy in the
decision-making process of designing, managing, and funding the projects.

#### One-Stop Job Centers
The JG need not reinvent the wheel in terms of administrative infrastructure. Local unemployment offices have already been rebranded as local job centers, also called One-Stop Career Centers or American Job Centers. They are already charged with providing many services to the unemployed, from the actual payments (UI checks) to job-search assistance, referrals, training, GED completion, resume building, English as a second language, instruction in math and reading, and other one-on-one services, such as stress management and financial planning.

These unemployment offices can become genuine employment offices by also offering employment opportunities on demand through the JG. Due to chronic job shortages, current attempts to match unemployed workers with employers are largely ineffective. While some outfits may do better than others, in the absence of readily available and abundant job opportunities, going through an unemployment office can often be a stressful and even punitive experience. While they offer some training and education services, at the macro level, training tends to serve the function of shifting people along the unemployment line. 

These outfits can become fully functional One-Stop Job Centers and provide the needed JG employment opportunities, while continuing to assist the enrollees with training, education, and transitioning to private sector employment opportunities. Under the JG program they essentially become the hubs for the local jobs bank that link interested individuals with JG positions.

#### Public Institutions, NGOs, and Social Enterprises
These are the project-executing organizations. As discussed above, during the design phase of the program, a series of organizations can be identified that will supply opportunities on demand. Others can be added over time. The job opportunities with these organizations are “inventoried” with the Community Jobs Banks/job centers. 

Once the unemployed have been registered at the One-Stop Job Centers, they are provided a menu of work options with the project-executing organizations.

Identification of project-executing organizations is contingent on the general guidelines provided by the DOL, which are in turn informed by the mission statement of the JG. The types of work/jobs that will be performed, as well as the organizations that will employ the unemployed, will be contingent on what is defined as the “public purpose.”

#### Participatory Democracy
One of the aspirations of the JG program is to foster a process whereby jobs and projects are proposed and managed from the bottom up—i.e., via direct input of community members and other stakeholders. Because it is a locally based program that targets the needs of the community and its members, the program lends itself to broad participation of constituents in its design and operation.

Indeed, for its long-term success, participatory governance is likely a prerequisite. There are many models and real-world experiences that can inform a design that incorporates citizen engagement, public decision-making, and local institution building. For example, participatory budgeting can ensure that municipalities rely on citizen input about the local projects that require funding and involve them in the budgeting process itself. Experience with participatory budgeting shows that it significantly improves the effectiveness and results of local social programs.

It may be considered desirable for the federal government to provide only 85 percent of all the funding, requesting that nonprofits, municipalities, and other social enterprises participate with some resources. These can take the form of physical resources, e.g., some of the materials or facilities where the work will take place can come from the project-executing agencies. This arrangement could create local stakeholders and additional buy-in from states and communities.

Because the program aspires for citizen input, because it drastically reduces the threat of unemployment, because it puts pressure on punitive labor practices in the private sector, because it establishes a labor standard for pay and working conditions, and because it focuses exclusively on investing in the public good, it can be an institution with profound democratizing tendencies, and a conduit for transformative change in the workplace, people’s everyday lives, and the economy as a whole.


### 7. Types of Jobs: “National Care Act”
Large-scale jobs programs are often identified with large-scale infrastructure projects. And while it is vital to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure as a matter of national priority, it is difficult to fluctuate infrastructure investment with changes in the business cycle. Furthermore, infrastructure jobs are often high skill and predominantly male. Therefore they are not always suitable for running the JG as an ongoing long-run program for all that provides employment opportunities to the least-skilled and most marginalized groups in the labor market.

Working to address looming environmental challenges can generate millions of public service jobs for years to come. There is a lot of “invisible” environmental work that is labor intensive and can be done by people of various skill levels. This work must be performed on an ongoing basis and could provide the needed job opportunities, without competing with the private sector. Establishing and fortifying our nation’s infrastructure to prevent, mitigate, and withstand the impact of intensifying hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, and floods requires imme diate action and a large labor force. And if a large infrastructure program is attempted alongside the JG, the latter will likely be smaller and it will continue to guarantee job opportunities to those who cannot work on infrastructure projects.

Infrastructure alone is not a particularly reliable method for employing all of the unemployed who are scattered across the country. Many of them live in communities that maynot need levees or fire prevention efforts, and yet experience multiple other deprivations, such as limited access to healthy food or care for the young and elderly, to name a few.

The proposal herein is to design the JG as a “National Care Act” that will help fill those needs gaps. With input from community groups, ideally emerging from a participatory decision-making process, localities and municipalities can determine the specific jobs that will be performed under the JG along the following three strategic objectives:

1. Care for the environment;
2. Care for the community; and
3. Care for the people

#### Care for the Environment

A revival of FDR’s Tree Army and the formation of a 21st century Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) would create JG jobs in close proximity to the unemployed. Since all communities have acute environmental needs, the camp-based CCC model from the New Deal is not appropriate or desirable. Instead, jobs will be created where the workers live.

The Community Jobs Bank will include a list of monitoring programs, rehabilitation programs, and public investment programs. The jobs will tackle: soil erosion, flood control, environmental surveys, species monitoring, park maintenance and renewal, removal of invasive species, sustainable agriculture practices to address the “food desert”2 problems in the United States, support for local fisheries, community supported agriculture (CSA) farms, community and rooftop gardens, tree planting, fire and other disaster prevention measures, weatherization of homes, and composting.

#### Care for the Community
Communities are best rebuilt from within. Many communities throughout the United States experience urban blight, poverty, and crime. The JG can employ existing best practices to mobilize the human potential within a community to revive it and make it more resilient. 

Jobs can include: cleanup of vacant properties, reclamation of materials, restoration of public spaces, and other small infrastructure investments; establishment of school gardens, urban farms, co-working spaces, solar arrays, tool lending libraries, classes and programs, and community theaters; construction of playgrounds; restoration of historical sites; organization of carpooling programs, as well as recycling, reuse, and water-collection initiatives, food waste programs, and oral histories projects.

#### Care for the People
The JG aims to support individuals and families, filling the particular need gaps they may be facing. Projects would include: elderly care; afterschool programs; and special programs for children, new mothers, at-risk youth, veterans, former inmates, and people with disabilities. One advantage of the JG is that it also provides job opportunities to the very people benefiting from these programs. In other words, the program gives them agency. For example, the at-risk youth themselves participate in the execution of the afterschool activities that aim to benefit them. The veterans themselves can work for and benefit from different veterans’ outreach programs.

Jobs in these projects can include: organizing afterschool activities or adult skill classes in schools or local libraries; facilitating extended-day programs for school children; shadowing teachers, coaches, hospice workers and librarians to learn new skills and assist them in their duties; organizing nutrition surveys in schools; and coordinating health awareness programs for young mothers.

Other examples include organizing urban campuses, co-ops, classes and training, and apprenticeships in sustainable agriculture, and all of the above-mentioned community care jobs, which could produce a new generation of urban teachers, artists and artisans, makers, and inventors.

All of the above-mentioned tasks are already being done in one form or another. And all of them are in short supply. What is needed is more helping hands and a budget to employ them. That is the function of the JG. In other words, the JG can benefit from already-existing best practices in these areas and simply scale-up the production of these public goods and investments in human capital.


### 8. Project Examples

#### Example 1
The city mobilizes able-bodied men and women with varied skill levels for a massive cleanup of vacant lots, focusing on rehabilitation and reclamation of materials. Disabled individuals, who may have difficulty with physical work but have basic computer skills and wish to work, create a database documenting the cleanup efforts, cataloguing the reclaimed materials, and offering office-based logistical support. At-risk youth help with park cleanup and apprentice with local construction companies in building, painting, and landscaping skate parks and basketball courts. The city undertakes greening projects and rehabilitation of abandoned public spaces.

#### Example 2
A former coal mining community experiences city blight, mass unemployment, and a high incidence of health problems. The JG organizes a comprehensive program for restoring the natural environment using the abandoned coal mine, based on existing best practices (e.g., in some Appalachian areas in the United States). Abandoned mines are filled with water to create man-made lakes. The work involves construction of infrastructure that directs rivers into the empty craters—work that is suitable for the skill level of the unemployed miners. Others are employed in a mass reforestation effort to plant appropriate tree species that restore the ecosystem, stem soil erosion, and reintroduce important lost wildlife to the region. The municipalities organize food insecurity, water quality, and malnutrition surveys. They launch a comprehensive community garden program.

#### Example 3
Local CSAs propose to organize and build community gardens throughout the city. They employ local unemployed residents to setup and run the gardens. Produce is distributed to members, sold in local farmers markets, or delivered free of charge to low-income families. In addition to building community gardens, the CSA employs people to build greenhouses and aquaponics operations, and run classes for adults and youth related to sustainable agriculture. Local CSAs can offer full- and part-time work opportunities and flexible working arrangements.

#### Example 4
A local green nonprofit institute has extensive experience in creating, protecting, and expanding the network of public trails. On short notice it absorbs anyone available to work on trail maintenance and repair. In addition, the nonprofit works on removing invasive species from local areas. The species removal necessitates soil erosion prevention efforts, all of which need to be staffed on an ongoing basis. The institute also runs an eel and herring monitoring program. People with different skill levels are employed to perform the different tasks—most of the above do not require much, if any, training or experience. Workers with higher skills can assist in creating maps, documenting the species, and performing research as needed. The nonprofit also offers courses, seminars, and hands-on experience for youth and adults in environmental conservation. It also provides flexible working arrangements for those with child or elder care responsibilities.

#### Example 5
A local artist collective employs painters, actors, musicians, and stagehands to run year-round productions for the community. They organize school outreach programs, run summer camps, and offer free art and music classes and literacy-through-the-arts courses for special needs youth. They collaborate with local schools in offering art enrichment programs. 

#### Example 6
The local public schools enroll in the Community Jobs Bank and provide a list of “shelved” projects and programs that can be staffed with JG workers. Some schools would like to expand their playgrounds, and repaint and weatherize their facilities. Others would like to offer a greater variety of afterschool activities. Most need teacher’s aide to assist with low-performing students, lesson plan preparation, and in-class activities. 

The tasks require various degrees of skill and experience. New labor market entrants, such as college students who are having trouble finding a job, enroll as teacher’s aids through the JG program. They gain valuable training and hands-on experience, should they wish to go in the field. Former stay-at-home parents who are ready to return to work assist in running new afters school programs. Skilled workers who may be seasonally laid off help with weatherization projects.

### VII. POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE JOB GUARANTEE

### VIII.CONCLUSION
Many social problems are solved via direct measures. When the problem is lack of education, the government guarantees access to public education; when the problem is lack of retireement income, the government guarantees retirement income (Social Security); when people lack food or shelter, government programs provide food or shelter. Most of these (once e very successful) programs have been under pressure for a while: they have been underfunded and/or reformed with eligibility criteria that are often punitive. Still, they provide a safety net, in the absence of which poverty and destitution in the United States would be much higher than it is today. Yet, when it comes to jobs, we do not have a similarly direct approach. 

When someone needs a job, the right response is to provide a job, not simply a pittance of unemployment insurance or a training program. The JG provides (directly) what people in the labor market need. It is a public option for jobs. And just like we have public options for primary education and retirement income, we require one for jobs. 

Before 1935 there was no retirement and disability safety net in the United States. Today government direct spending on Social Security (Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance) is over 4 percent of GDP. In 1965 we expanded the safety net to include Medicare and Medicaid and direct spending on these programs is another 4 percent. By comparison, the JG is a much smaller program, yet it guarantees a crucial component of the safety net that is still missing — one that strengthens individuals, families, and communities, creates essential public goods, and provides a superior countercyclical stabilizer to the economy. 

This paper provides one blueprint for operationalizing the JG proposal. The principle that guides this design is that the JG has to be a program available to all who wish to work at a base, living wage, the work has to be meaningful to the workers and the community, and the budget must be flexible in order to accommodate fluctuations in layoffs over the business cycle.

Since unemployment is largely invisible, the enormous social costs it produces are also hidden and not normally accounted for by conventional macroeconomic policy. These costs are already borne by society and produce large, negative, and seemingly intractable externalities. Therefore, supplying jobs for their own sake is a worthy goal in and of itself. However, the blueprint offered herein suggests multiple ways in which the JG can improve the public good as well as the lives of the unemployed, their families, communities, and the economy in general.


### APPENDIX I: JOB GUARANTEE AND INCOME INEQUALITY
A rising tide, the saying goes, lifts all boats. This has not been the case in the United States for several decades. In the postwar period known as the Golden Age, when the economy grew, most US families took the biggest (albeit shrinking) slice of that growth. That changed in the 1980s, when real average income for the bottom 90 percent of households barely grew during each expansion (figure e A1). Worse, average real income in 2015 (the latest available data) wa as the same as it was in 1997. At the same time, health and education costs have more than doubled, while good jobs with decent pay remain in short supply. By contrast, incomes of the wealthiest 1 percent and 0.1 percent of households have grown handsomely (figure A2). Economic growth no longer means shared prosperity.

The job guarantee (JG) makes important strides towards reducing income inequality, though it is by no means a panacea to the problem. It ensures full employment, thereby prioritizing labor income from work. As such it raises the floor by ensuring that no one falls below an income of $15 per hour plus basic benefits. It offers decent jobs at decent pay to everyone who needs one, thus helping precisely those individuals and families who experience long and deep spells of unemployment and who juggle several part-time jobs to make ends meet.

Due to its “bubble up” effect on the economy, the JG indirectly improves incomes of other workers who are at the bottom and middle of the income distribution. Because it eliminates jobless recoveries and ensures that growth becomes a result of proemployment policies (compared to the current situation, where jobs are supposed to be a consequence of growth but in reality we end up with jobless recoveries), it changes the predistribution of income by favoring income from work, as opposed to income from speculative financial activities (for example). As noted, for a more equitable distribution of income, much more than the JG will be required—especially policies that reduce excessive incomes at the top of the income distribution. However these policies are not a prerequisite for passing and running the JG.




APPEENDIX II: UNEMPLOYMENT——A SILENT EPIDEMIC
Figure A3: Chronic Unemployment

Unemployment spreads like a disease. Though the Great Recession officially lasted only 2 years and the economy began recovering in 2010, many communities across the Unites States lived with depression-level unemployment rates for many years. And in some areas, double-digit unemployment is the norm even in strong expansions. 

And just like a disease, unemployment inflicts enourmous economic and social costs on people and the economy. It increases mortality and suicide rates. It causes "death of despair" - that is the pain, distress, and social dysfunction that emerged from the loss of stable blue-collar work that started in the 1970s and continued well after the Great Recession. It produces a permanent loss in a person's lifetime earnings and inflicts multifaceted physical and mental health problems on the unemployed, but also on their spouses and children. It is linked to crime, urban blight, poverty, homelessness, and other social ills. Estimates indicate that the US economy foregoes $0.5-$10 billion of *output per day* fue to mass unemployment. The list of social, economic, political, and financial costs is long - a cost that society bears. 

Research shows that 85-90 percent of the unbearable costs of unemployment are nonpecuniary, meaning that interventions based on income support alone will be inadequate. Having a job for most people means much more than just having an income. Plan *Jefes* in Argentina, which was modeled after the JG proposal in the United States, shows that for participants, income is the second-to-last reason why they enjoyed working in the program  (Tcherneva 2013)

The JG is a crucial preventative tool for fighting the unemployment disease. First, it never allows unemployment to develo and accelerate rapidly as it does under the status quo. As a result, it fundamentally changes spending patterns by drastically reducing economic insecurity.

It creates the greates number of jobs in communities with the highest level of unemployment. It helps protect against the social ills stemming from joblessness. In other words, the JG not only stops the contagion effect from unemploymnent in its tracks, but also thwarts the social and economic costs of unemployment. It is, in a sense, a method of inoculation.
